Just a collection of projects I do during my internship to keep me sharp~

I don't have as much time as most students do, due to my circumstances in life, so I try to dedicate a few hours a day to do little projects to show 
basic programming abilities

I hope this brings you joy!

summary per project:

hangman.py: to keep up on my python skills - self explanatory if you know what hangman is
password_checker: checks if your inputted password would work against the criteria most websites have for their users passwords these days
