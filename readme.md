Just a collection of projects I do during my internship to keep me sharp~

I don't have as much time as most students do, due to my circumstances in life, so I try to dedicate a few hours a day to do little projects to show 
basic programming abilities

I hope this brings you joy!

**Summary per project:**

**hangman.py**: to keep up on my python skills - self explanatory if you know what hangman is

**password_checker**: checks if your inputted password would work against the criteria most websites have for their users passwords these days

**threadcomposite**: uses threading to determine if certain numbers are composite or not given an array of numbers

**musicTime folder**: creates a gui for the user to play notes to hear how they sound, and plays all given notes in a sequence!

**webscraper101.py**: My first experience with learning about webscraping and beautiful soup! I wanted to understand the basics, so I made a webscraper
that will take in two netflix movie/show links and give let the user know if they share any common genres, cast members or release dates!

**honeycharm**: My first discord bot with 14 commands! from games, to weather to a mini pokemon simulation, my bot can do it all :) Endless amounts of fun with honeycharms quirky statements and options and it combines everything I've reviewed so far!
